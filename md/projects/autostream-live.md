[Autostream.Live](https://www.autostream.live/) is a web-tool for managing your media content using the cloud. Autostream.Live allows you to create live streams on the cloud in many different ways. By creating live streams on the cloud you won't have to worry about unreliable hardware or internet. 

## Technical Challenges

### Cost

The primary challenge for this project is cost. We want to make sure that we can provide a service that is cheap to run and cheap to use. We are currently using AWS for our cloud infrastructure, but we are looking into other cloud providers to see if we can reduce our costs. The amount of data that we need to store and process is quite large, so we need to make sure that we can do this in a cost effective way.


## Features

### Offline Streaming

Choose the audio and the primary video/images (mp4, jpg, gif...), add overlay video/images and we process all of this internally then live stream from our servers!

### Multi-Service Streaming (planned)

Stream to Youtube, Twitch, Facebook Live, Tiktok and many others concurrently. Custom RTMP links are also supported!

### Desktop/Mobile Cloud Streaming (planned)

Stream your desktop, specific windows, specific tabs, directly from your browser to any live streaming service that supports RTMP.

Stream your mobile screen or cameras directly from your the app to any live streaming service that supports RTMP.
